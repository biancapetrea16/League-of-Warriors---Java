README - League of Warriors PART 2 
Name: Petrea Bianca-Iulia 322 CC  
Difficulty level:  - challenges faced: making sure the different interfaces (login, character selection, game board) 
worked well together and reopen properly, without glitches like white frames or incomplete 
updates. To fix this, I used modal dialogs for user input and made sure frames were closed and 
reopened correctly 
Time spent: 30-35 hours 
Project description: 
League of Warriors is an adventure game implemented in Java. The game represents a player 
navigating a grid-based map where each cell triggers a specific event. This project emphasizes 
the application of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and design patterns in Java. 
Implemented features: - User authentication: a graphical interface for login and character selection. 
• LoginPanel: graphical interface for email and password 
• CharacterPanel: display a list of available characters from the current account for the 
player to choose from. - Grid-Based Map: interaction with cell elements (enemy, sanctuary, portal, void) 
• GameBoard: a visual representation of the grid and gameplay interactions - Battle: attacks between the player and the enemy 
• BattlePage: displays character and enemy’s information. The player can choose whether 
to use normal attack or an ability. - Normal Attack: direct attack on the enemy; - Use Ability: a separate window displays available abilities, showing their damage and 
mana cost. The player selects an ability to use, after which the enemy takes its turn. - Leveling System: players gain experience points by defeating enemies or completing events. 
• FinalPage: displays the character's progress after leveling up, including experience 
gained, level achieved, number of enemies defeated. - Game Over: The game ends when the character's life reaches zero. If other characters are 
available, the character selection window reopens, allowing the player to continue. If there are no 
more available characters on that account, the player must login into another account.
